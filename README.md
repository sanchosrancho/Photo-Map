Photo-Map
=========

This is example code which shows the Photo from Camera Roll as Annotations on the World Map and groups them by the region.

The group feature is based on Matt Jarjoura's ideas he demonstrated in 2011 on WWDC in demo section of "Visualizing Information Geographically with MapKit" (https://developer.apple.com/videos/wwdc/2011/).
